# battleship-game-in-java
In this project, we design the battleship game graphically using Java language and the JavaFX library, which has the following features:
- User defining
- Specific time for each turn of the game
- Number of wins, percentage of wins, rank

### We implement the game in two modes:
#### 1.Player vs. Player mode:
Two players register their names and take turns choosing the location of their ships. After both are confirmed, the game starts, and the players take turns targeting the opponent's screen.
#### 2.Player vs. CPU mode:
Including all features of the program plus:
CPU starts the game randomly; also, CPU moves should be smart.
